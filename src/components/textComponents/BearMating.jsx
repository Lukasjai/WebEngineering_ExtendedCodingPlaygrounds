        <h2>Mating Rituals</h2>
        <p>
            Bears are romantic creatures by nature and will naturally look for a mate that they can spend the rest of
            their lives with. They will woo a potential suitor by making their dwelling look attractive — for example,
            with cave paintings or a bed of reeds in the case of a wild bear, and mood lighting and a Michael Bublé CD
            in the case of an urban bear.
