        <h2>Habitats and Eating Habits</h2>
        <p>
            Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other naturally growing ingredients. In general,
            they will hunt for food themselves in woodland or rivers, but at a push they will track down their
            sustenance
            from farms or country houses. They tend to live in relative isolation, in caves, tents, or cottages.

        </div>
        <p>
            Urban (gentrified) bears, on the other hand, have largely abandoned the old ways. They will hunt other
            urban creatures if necessary (including other predators like rats and foxes), but prefer to scavenge from
            readily available urban food outlets like dumpsters, bins, and fast food joints. When food has proven
            scarce,
            urban bears have even been known to break into people's kitchens and steal essentials like baked beans,
            ready meals, and microwave ovens.

        <p>
            Urban bears will sleep anywhere they can, from bus shelters and parks to the toilets in McDonalds, to
            their own apartment.
