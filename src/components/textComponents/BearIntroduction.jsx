        <h1>The Trouble with Bears</h1>
        <p>By Evan Wild</p>
        <p>
            Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures,
            self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from
            renowned documentary, <em>The Jungle Book</em>.

            So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision? In
            this article, we try to answer those questions, and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.

        <h2>Types of Bear</h2>
        <p>
            Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear,
            then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.

            Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large and medium bears are just as at home
            in urban areas as they are in the countryside. Different habitats encourage different behaviour however, as
            you'll find out below. The below table also gives you some useful facts about bears.
